# GEOTREK RANDO V2 ![master](https://api.travis-ci.org/makinacorpus/Geotrek-rando.svg?branch=master)
### Public portal of Geotrek (http://geotrek.fr).


# OVERVIEW
V2 currently under heavy development. It still need an old geotrek rando for data fetching.

# INSTALL

clone the current repository and then :

### Install NPM
```
npm install
```

### Launch gulp distribution task
```
gulp --dist
```
It will :
* create missing config files
* create translation files
* bundle all the app js files in src/rando.js
* compile sass files and bundle them in src/rando.css, src/rando-vendors.js
* bundle all vendors js files in src/vendors.js 


### Config the app
Minimum config: 
1 - change the `PLATFORM_ID` at the top of the previously created `config.js` file with a *unique id* as it will be used for localStorage.


# DEVELOPMENT

### Launch gulp bundling and watching task
```
gulp
```
Launch the app on localhost:3000 and watch for any change in sass or js files in src folder :
* Each time a sass file is changed, the wole css is reinjected
* Each time a js file is saved, the browser's tab is refreshed
* Will alow you to change your config file without needing to relaunch gulp

Options :
```
--vendors
```
-> Will also bundle vendors on first launch. You need to do it the first time you launch the dev version if you haven't done any gulp --dist before. 

Please note that you currently need to force CORS request in your browser in order to get data from our test server.
