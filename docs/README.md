# Geotrek-rando documentation

## Overview

Geotrek-rando is [FLOSS][] dedicated to display geographic and touristic contents.

These contents may be provided by linking this app either to the API of a [Geotrek-admin][] instance or directly to static datas generated by a [Geotrek-admin][] instance _(Cf. [data source][])_.

Geotrek-rando is build as a [Single Page Application][SPA] using [AngularJS][] as main application framework, [Leaflet][] for displaying the maps, and many other smaller libraries and utilities.
Everything is bound as a single javascript bundle using [Browserify][], managed through [Gulp][] tasks.

## Prerequisites

As Geotrek-rando works as a [SPA][], you only need an http server as [Nginx][] or [Apache][]. _(Cf. [http server][])_

You'll also need to build the javascript main bundle which require [nodejs and npm][node]\* to be available on the building environment.

Building environment could be either the same as your http server, or a local machine from which you'll sync generated files to the main server instance


_\* In recent versions of Geotrek-rando, you'll find the recommended version of Node JS into the `.nvmrc` file in the root directory of the project._

###Â For developpers

Some npm package used for tests may need a build environment for compiling platform specific binaries. On debian-like environments, `build-essential` should include this requirements.

_See [contribute][] section for more details about participating to Geotrek-rando development._

## Configuration

Most of the configuration (mainly everything about contents) has to be done directly in [Geotrek-admin][], but some parameters regarding Geotrek-rando have to be set up in a specific file. _(Cf. [Custom settings][])_

**NB:** Each time you add, delete or modify a setting, you have to rebuild the main javascript bundle.
