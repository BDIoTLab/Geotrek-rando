# Geotrek-rando documentation

## Overview

Geotrek-rando is [FLOSS][] dedicated to display geographic and touristic contents. These contents may be provided by linking this app either to the API of a [Geotrek-admin][] instance or directly to static datas generated by a [Geotrek-admin][] instance.

Geotrek-rando is build as a [Single Page Application][SPA] using [AngularJS][] as main application framework, [Leaflet][] for displaying the maps, and many other smaller libraries and utilities. Everything is bound as a single javascript bundle using [Browserify][], managed through [Gulp][] tasks.

## Prerequisites

As Geotrek-rando works as a [SPA][], you only need an http server as [Nginx][] or [Apache][]. Some configuration examples will be given for Nginx.

You'll also need to build the javascript main bundle which require [nodejs and npm][node] to be available on the building environment*.

_\* Building environment could be either the same as your http server, or a local machine from which you'll sync generated files to the main server instance._
