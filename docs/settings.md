# Settings & customization

##Â Settings

There are two files in Geotrek-rando managing client side settings:

### `settings.custom.json`

> This file should remain a valid [json][] file.
> Remember to check its validity each time you alter it.

Most of the settings you can add to this file can be copied from another one named `settings.default.json` which contains default settings.

### `_config-custom.scss`
